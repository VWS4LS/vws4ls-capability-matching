# Capability Matching

This is a result from the research project "VWS4LS". It provides functionality
to check if a certain machine is able to provide a certain capability required
to produce (parts of) a wiring harness. One example would be to crimp a certain
contact with a wire of a certain diameter.

This repository contains to projects:

- The actual algorithm to execute a capability check (see [capability-check/readme.md](./capability-check/readme.md))
- The definition of a node for Node-RED (see [capability-check-node-red/readme.md](./capability-check-node-red/readme.md))
